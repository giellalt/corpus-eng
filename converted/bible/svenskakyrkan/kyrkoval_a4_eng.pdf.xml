<p>Where should the Church of Sweden place its strength?</p>
<p>The Church of Sweden has 7.1 million members. On 18 September all members who are 16 years of age or older and are registered in Sweden will then have the opportunity to influence the life and work of the Church of Sweden in the coming four years. The activities of the Church of Sweden are extensive and cover a broad field. The Church wants to be a place for questions and conversations, a welcoming refuge characterized by spirituality and the encounter with the living God. A church permeated by hope focusing on the spiritual well-being of every individual – siding with the oppressed and vulnerable. A place where Christian values are made concrete both at home and further afar, both in times of happiness and sorrow, in everyday life and on solemn occasions.</p>
<p>The church elections are three or four elections In the church elections you will vote in three or four elections, depending on the local organisation of your parish:1) directly elected parish council. Here issues concerning parish life are handled, for example which activities are conducted and which goals the parish should work towards.2) board for an association of parishes. Several parishes often work together financially and administratively in an association. A Board for an association of parishes makes decisions on the administration of resources, property issues and the like.3) diocesan council. The Church of Sweden is divided into thirteen dioceses. Each diocese is lead by a bishop. Supporting the parishes and developing its work are some of the diocese’s tasks.4) church assembly. The Church Assembly is the highest decision-making body of the Church of Sweden consisting of 251 members. Here issues of national interest are decided, for example matters concerning Church regulations on baptism, confirmation, marriage and funerals.</p>

You will then need a <span type="quote">“postal voting package”</span> which can be ordered from your pastoral or parish office. It contains everything you need, including blank ballots, which you can complete yourself. However you can generally receive pre-printed ballots from the nominating group for which you intend to vote. Your postal vote must have reached us no later than 14 September.vote by proxy Voting by proxy is done in a similar way to postal voting, but is primarily an option for those who intended to vote at a polling station and are unable to do so on election day. The <span type="quote">“postal voting package”</span> also contains what you need to vote by proxy.</p>
<p>Who can you elect?</p>
<p>In the church elections you vote for a so called <span type="quote">“nominating group”</span>, the equivalent of the political parties in the public elections.</p>
<p>You can also cast votes supporting a particular candidate, by ticking for the candidate that you prefer to be elected on the nominating group’s list.</p>
<p>The nominating groups themselves provide information on how they would like the Church to work and act in the future, where the Church of Sweden should place its strength. As a rule you can find out which groups you can vote for from your parish. You can also find the lists at www.svenskakyrkan.se.</p>
<p>Election results The preliminary results will be published on www.svenskakyrkan.se as they are counted after the polling locations have closed. The final results will be published on www.svenskakyrkan.se as soon as the diocese concerned has verified all the votes.</p>
<p>As a voting member you should have received your voting card in the post no later than 31 August. Personal details, as to which elections you may vote in, as well as where and when you can vote, are stated on the voting card.</p>
<p>If you have lost your voting card, or if it contains errors, you can turn to the Church Synod (Kyrkostyrelsen), Svenska kyrkan, 751 70 Uppsala, 018-16 96 00 (Information service), or order a new card at www.svenskakyrkan.se. Those who have not received a voting card, but consider themselves entitled to vote, should also turn to the Church Synod.</p>
<p>The voting card is sent to your registered address. A duplicate voting card can be faxed to the parish in which you vote and to the Church of Sweden’s parishes abroad.</p>
