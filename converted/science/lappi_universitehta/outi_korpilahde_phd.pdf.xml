<p>The thesis examines the lives of Finnish women who have entered and settled in Sámi communities as wives and daughters-in-law. Of particular interest in the research are public perceptions of the agency and place of the women.</p>
<p>Through its analysis of the women’s biographical reports on joining the Sámi community, the study offers space for their voices, the voices of a group that to date has been overlooked in the literatureresearch.</p>
<p>The Sámi region has long been a site of intercultural re-lationships and families. The women studied in the present work are older women in the community who came to the</p>
<p>Sámi area some 60 years ago and have thus have seen many extensive changes.</p>
<p>The research contributes to the scientific debate on inter-cultural relationships and families. My study analyses the de-gree to which everyday practices explain the course taken by relationships between Sámi and Finnish families. Specifically, it addresses the question: What new knowledge and skills is an entrant required to learn and what kind of resources does she need in settling down in the Sámi region and a Sámi commu-nity? I approach the study of everyday experiences through the concept of agency and consider the question of resources in terms of cultural and social capital.</p>
<p>The research shows that the essence of settling in a new community is acquiring the necessary cultural and social ca-pital and learning the rules of the game. One challenge that the Finnish women encountered was the community’s need to the women feeling that they were outsiders. Based on the analysis, I introduce a new concept, saamelaistapaisuus, or</p>
<p>Sámi habitus, which the women adopted gradually, but never completely.</p>
<p>In light of my findings, I see Finnish wives in Sámi com-munities as having a significant role as cultural interpreters between the Sámi and Finnish cultures. They develop into multicultural professionals who are both familiar with Fin-nish culture and actively engaged in acquiring the essential skills and knowledge of Sámi culture.</p>
