    <p>ABSTRACT</p>
    <p>New  Waters,  Reflections  of  Obscurity.  Industrial  Colonialism  through  the  Swedish Hydropower Development in the Reindeer Herding Areas 1910-1968.</p>
    <p>Hydropower development was one of the first systematic large-scale exploitations in the reindeer herding areas within Swedish borders. Therefore, this thesis departs from postcolonial approaches wherein the Swedish state policy and practice towards Sami, reindeer herders and Sápmi, the Sami homeland, is analysed as colonialism in relation to hydropower development.  The study spans over the first large-scale hydropower projects in the reindeer herding area during the 1910’s and 1920’s, continuing with the decreased legal security during the second world war, and finally the opposition and opinion in the 1950’s and 1960’s, enabled by the establishment of a national association for Swedish Sami, SSR.       The industrialisation  of  watercourses in the reindeer herding areas were brought about by the works of an institutional framework consisting of the Water Act and the Reindeer  Grazing  Act  together  with  the  tutelage  of  a  Lapp  Administration.  These institutions made invisible both reindeer herding as an industry and the herders rights. Authorities as well as hydropower companies acted and argued within an industrial colonial  discourse.  One  technique  was  the  re-writing  of  history  and  of  the  herders’ rights in favour of power developers. The Swedish hydropower system was built up based on cheap energy from the North, at the expense of stakeholders’ rights. This was made possible by arguing that exploitation was  for the sake of <span type="quote">”the common  good”</span>. When  reindeer  herders  eventually  were  noted  in  the  process,  reindeer  herding  was regarded as a vested interest  and reindeer herding rights as a privilege given to the Sami by the state. In this system reindeer herders were given a more vulnerable legal position than farmers, in addition non-reindeer herding Sami were in some aspects even more affected by discriminating structures. By damming the watercourses, the grazing lands were reduced which affected the amount of herders that could practice reindeer husbandry and thereby also the amount of individuals holding Sami rights.       During  the  1950’s  and  1960’s  the  self-evidenced  hydropower  development  was questioned by a Sami struggle for justice. With regards to Sami rights, the situation was more stagnant due to the state avoiding official investigation of certain legal issues that were object for trial. However, the industrial colonial discourse and the governing of  hydropower  politics  were  challenged  and  the  authorities  changed  some  of  their notions of reindeer herders. Nevertheless, the Sami were denied representation and involvement  in  governing  the  finances  that  were  aimed  at  alleviation  of  the consequences of various interferences in the herding area.</p>
