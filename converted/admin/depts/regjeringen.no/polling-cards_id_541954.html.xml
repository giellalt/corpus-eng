<p>All electors are sent a polling card by post from their municipal authority. The polling card is based on the National Population Register’s information about the elector’s residential address as at 30 June of the election year. This is the address that determines which municipality you have a right to vote in.</p>
<p>On the polling card you will find information about polling hours and which polling station you must use on Election Day.</p>
<p>If you vote in advance, you can cast your vote in any municipality in Norway. Your vote will then be sent to your home municipality.</p>
<p>You do not need to take your polling card with you in order to vote, but it simplifies the work of the electoral officials if you do. So you will be able to vote more quickly if you take your polling card with you. If you have not received your polling card in the post, or have lost it, you can still go along to the polling station to vote. The polling card is not valid as proof of identity.</p>
<p>If you have other questions about your polling card, please contact your municipal authority.</p>
