<p type="title">Ban on landings of mackerel from Faroese and Icelandic vessels</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[29.07.2010]</p>
<p>- The irresponsible fishing for mackerel which Iceland and the Faroe Islands have initiated as an attempt to secure future quota shares is a serious threat to the mackerel stock, and undermines the cooperation to secure the necessary conservation measures. I consider this situation very seriously, and it has been the topic of discussions between myself and the European Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, Norwegian Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Lisbeth Berg-Hansen says in a comment.</p>

<p type="title">The Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs given responsibility for setting up BarentsWatch</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[25.06.2010]</p>
<p>The Norwegian Government has decided to give the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs the responsibility for setting up a new, full-spectrum monitoring and information system for the Northern sea and coastal areas (<span type="quote" xml:lang="deu">“BarentsWatch”</span>). The work will be headed up by the Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA). The Norwegian Mapping Authority, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and many other specialist bodies will be involved in the work.</p>

<p type="title">The Norwegian Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs  meets the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[22.06.2010]</p>
<p>The Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs met the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament 22 June 2010, where the Norwegain Minister presented Norwegian fisheries management and expressed the need for close cooperation between the EU and Norway.</p>

<p type="title">Very good results in combating illegal fishing</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[26.04.2010]</p>
<p><span type="quote">“A concerted effort by the Norwegian and Russian authorities has halted illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) catches of cod in the Barents Sea, which were estimated at more than 100 000 tonnes a year. Last year, no IUU fishing of cod was detected. The Government has given high priority to combating IUU fishing in the Barents Sea, and the results speak for themselves,”</span> said Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Lisbeth Berg-Hansen.</p>

<p type="title">Further review of salvage of German submarine U-864</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[05.03.2010]</p>
<p>The Government commissioned an external quality assurance report on the proposal for raising the wreck of the German submarine U-864 off the west coast of Norway. This has now been presented, and identifies a number of uncertainties. An accident involving release of the mercury cargo would be a threat to the marine and coastal environment. It has therefore been decided to commission an in-depth review to ensure that any salvage operation is properly planned, takes full account of environmental concerns, and has an acceptable level of risk.</p>

<p type="title">Norway and the EU have concluded a bilateral fisheries agreement for 2010 and a long-term agreement on management of North East Atlantic mackerel</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[26.01.2010]</p>
<p>- I am very content that these agreements have now been concluded, and that a difficult period of negotiations with the EU is over. We can now look forward with the view of finding joint solutions to new challenges. We had many rounds of negotiation with the EU last autumn, but the challenges were so difficult that we had to resume negotiations in January. It is of major importance for the fishing industry in Norway and the EU that we now have agreements in place. The industry can now continue their important value creation within a stable framework, said Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Lisbeth Berg-Hansen.</p>
