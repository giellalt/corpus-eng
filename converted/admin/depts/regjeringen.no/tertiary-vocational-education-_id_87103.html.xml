<p type="title">Tertiary Vocational Education</p>
<p>Tertiary vocational education is an alternative to higher education and is based on upper secondary education and training or equivalent informal and nonformal competence. Higher Education Entrance Qualification is not required.</p>
<p>The education consists of vocational courses lasting from half a year to two years. Apart from the traditional schools of technical management and maritime subjects which are publicly financed (by the county authorities), most of the schools offering this kind of education are private ones.</p>
<p>All courses must be accredited by the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education (NOKUT). An up-to-date list of recognised courses can be found on NOKUT’s website.</p>
