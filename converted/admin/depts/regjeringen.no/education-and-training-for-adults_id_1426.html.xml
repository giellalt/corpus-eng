<p type="title">Education and Training for Adults</p>
<p>Lifelong learning and opportunities for education for adults are important principles in Norwegian education policy. The aim is to make it possible for the adult segment of the population to strengthen their competence throughout their career pathways.</p>
<p>The age boom in the working community makes it even more important to adapt conditions to make it possible for adults also to take part in training, education and competence development.</p>
<p>The Competence Reform gave all adults who need it a statutory right to primary and lower secondary education (from 2002), and those who were born before 1978 were given the right to upper secondary education and training if they have not completed this kind of education earlier.</p>
<p>From2001 adults over 25 years were also given the right to admission to universities and university colleges based on formal, non-formal and informal qualifications.</p>
