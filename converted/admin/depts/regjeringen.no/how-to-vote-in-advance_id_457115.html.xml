<p type="title">Ordinary advance voting</p>
<p>Ordinary advance voting begins on 10 August. You can vote in advance up to and including 11 September.</p>
<p>The municipal authority receives advance votes. The municipal authority decides when and where you can vote in advance, and provides information about it.</p>
<p>The municipal authority also receives advance votes at medical and social institutions.</p>
<p>You can vote in advance in any municipality throughout Norway. You can therefore cast your vote in a different municipality from the one in which you are registered as an elector. If you vote outside the county in which you are registered as being resident, you will be provided with a white ballot on which only the registered political parties are listed. You must set a cross by or write which party/group you wish to vote for. You can also use a ballot paper brought from your own county.</p>
<p type="title">How to vote in advance:</p>
<list><p type="listitem">At the polling station, go to a polling officer, who will give you a ballot envelope and explain to you how to cast your vote.</p>
<p type="listitem">You go into the polling booth, choose a ballot paper (list), make any changes you might wish to, and then place the ballot paper in the ballot paper envelope.</p>
<p type="listitem">Go to the polling officer, who places the ballot paper envelope and your polling card in a cover envelope, which is then placed in the ballot box. The vote is sent to your home municipality to be counted.</p>
</list><p><em type="italic">Remember proof of identity (ID)! </em>The Election Act requires that a voter who is unknown to the returning officer shall show proof of identity. Examples of proof of identity are passport, driving licence and bank card with picture, but you can also use other proof of identity. The requirement is that it contains the voter’s name, date of birth and photograph. </p>
<p>It is not necessary to take a polling card with you, but it makes the polling officers’ work easier if you take it with you, and you can vote more quickly.</p>
<p>Remember that your vote must reach your home municipality by Election Day. You should therefore allow plenty of time.</p>
<p type="title">Are you sick or disabled?</p>
<p>If you are unable to come to a polling station because of illness or disability, you can apply to the electoral committee in your municipality to vote at home or the place where you are staying. The municipality will announce the deadline for applying to do so. If you are allowed to vote at home, someone from the municipal authority will come to your home and receive your advance vote there.</p>
<p type="title">Are you staying abroad?</p>
<p>If you live or for other reasons are staying abroad or on Svalbard or Jan Mayen, you can vote in advance at Norwegian foreign service stations or specially appointed vote recipients, or you can vote by post.</p>
<p>You may not vote on Election Day if you have voted in advance. Nor may you vote in advance more than once.</p>
