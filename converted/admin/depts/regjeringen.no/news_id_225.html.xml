<p xml:lang="vep">[04.04.2014]</p>
<p>Over the last few months Norway has witnessed a political debate about whether the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) should divest from all coal or petroleum companies. Today we announce that we have asked an Expert Group to look at how we should address the issue of climate gas emissions from coal and petroleum companies. The Expert Group's conclusions will be presented in Autumn 2014. However, independently of its recommendations, the GPFG will continue to be a well-diversified, global financial investor and not a policy tool, says Minister of Finance Siv Jensen.</p>
