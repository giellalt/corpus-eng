<p type="title">Children and young people</p>
<p>The Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion is responsible for the overriding sector policy for children and young people.</p>
<p>Children and young people must have good and safe conditions for their early development. They must have the same opportunities. Important areas of focus include counteracting marginalisation, contributing to levelling differences in living conditions and promoting the participation and influence of children and young people in various social arenas. Various Ministries and other state agencies, the municipal sector and voluntary organisations for children and young people work together to reach these objectives.</p>
