<p><em type="italic">Remember that you MUST have proof of identity in order to vote! </em></p>
<p>Election Day is 14 September 2009. In 205 municipalities the polling stations open on Sunday 13 September already.</p>
<p>If you vote on Election Day, 14 September (or 13 September in municipalities that have two-day elections) you must vote in the municipality in which you are registered as an elector. You are registered as an elector in the municipality in which you are registered as residing on 30 June in the election year.</p>
<p>The municipality announces where your local polling station is and how long it is open. Please note, however, that you can vote at any polling station in the municipality.</p>
<p><em type="italic">You must take proof of identity with you! </em>A polling card is not necessary, but it makes the polling officers’ work easier if you take it with you, and enables you to cast your vote more quickly. </p>
<p type="title">Do you need guidance or help?</p>
<p>If you need guidance or help at the polling station, you can ask one of the polling officers.</p>
<p>In principle, the municipal authorities are required to locate the polling stations in premises that electors can enter on their own. However, if the polling station is not in fact accessible to a disabled elector, he or she can vote right outside the polling station. Two polling officers will then come out, provide the necessary help and receive the ballot.</p>
<p type="title">Have you moved since 30 June 2009?</p>
<p>If you have moved since 30 June, you are registered as an elector in the municipality you have moved from, even if you have reported your move to the National Population Register. You are registered as an elector in the municipality in which you are registered in the National Population Register as residing on 30 June 2009.</p>
<p>You have voting rights and the right to cast your vote in the municipality in which you are registered as an elector. If you are unable to vote there on Election Day, you can vote in advance in the municipality in which you are at present. Your vote will then be sent to your home municipality.</p>
<p type="title">How to vote on Election Day</p>
<p>If you vote on Election Day, you do not use a ballot envelope. Instead, your ballot is folded and stamped before it is placed in the ballot box.</p>
<p type="title">This is how you vote at the Parliamentary Elecion:</p>
<p>1. Select the appropriate ballot paper.</p>
<p>2. Mark any changes you wish to make on</p>
<p>the ballot paper (see</p>
<p>instructions</p>
<p xml:lang="koi">).</p>
<p>3. Fold the ballot paper with the names of the parties inwards and the field for the stamp outwards – in this way, no one can see whom you vote for. The ballot paper should not be placed in an envelope or any other enclosure.</p>
<p>4. Take the ballot paper to the returning</p>
<p>officer to be stamped on the outside.</p>
<p>Only ballot papers that have been stamped are valid!</p>
<p>5. Place the stamped ballot paper in the</p>
<p>ballot box.</p>
