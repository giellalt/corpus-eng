<p type="title">Ban on landings of mackerel from Faroese and Icelandic vessels</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[29.07.2010]</p>
<p>- The irresponsible fishing for mackerel which Iceland and the Faroe Islands have initiated as an attempt to secure future quota shares is a serious threat to the mackerel stock, and undermines the cooperation to secure the necessary conservation measures. I consider this situation very seriously, and it has been the topic of discussions between myself and the European Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, Norwegian Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Lisbeth Berg-Hansen says in a comment.</p>

<p type="title">The Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs given responsibility for setting up BarentsWatch</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[25.06.2010]</p>
<p>The Norwegian Government has decided to give the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs the responsibility for setting up a new, full-spectrum monitoring and information system for the Northern sea and coastal areas (<span type="quote" xml:lang="deu">“BarentsWatch”</span>). The work will be headed up by the Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA). The Norwegian Mapping Authority, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and many other specialist bodies will be involved in the work.</p>

<p type="title">Very good results in combating illegal fishing</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[26.04.2010]</p>
<p><span type="quote">“A concerted effort by the Norwegian and Russian authorities has halted illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) catches of cod in the Barents Sea, which were estimated at more than 100 000 tonnes a year. Last year, no IUU fishing of cod was detected. The Government has given high priority to combating IUU fishing in the Barents Sea, and the results speak for themselves,”</span> said Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Lisbeth Berg-Hansen.</p>

<p type="title">Further review of salvage of German submarine U-864</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[05.03.2010]</p>
<p>The Government commissioned an external quality assurance report on the proposal for raising the wreck of the German submarine U-864 off the west coast of Norway. This has now been presented, and identifies a number of uncertainties. An accident involving release of the mercury cargo would be a threat to the marine and coastal environment. It has therefore been decided to commission an in-depth review to ensure that any salvage operation is properly planned, takes full account of environmental concerns, and has an acceptable level of risk.</p>

<p type="title">Norway and the EU have concluded a bilateral fisheries agreement for 2010 and a long-term agreement on management of North East Atlantic mackerel</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[26.01.2010]</p>
<p>- I am very content that these agreements have now been concluded, and that a difficult period of negotiations with the EU is over. We can now look forward with the view of finding joint solutions to new challenges. We had many rounds of negotiation with the EU last autumn, but the challenges were so difficult that we had to resume negotiations in January. It is of major importance for the fishing industry in Norway and the EU that we now have agreements in place. The industry can now continue their important value creation within a stable framework, said Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Lisbeth Berg-Hansen.</p>

<p type="title">Breakdown in the fisheries negotiations between Norway and the EU</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[08.12.2009]</p>
<p>- I am very disappointed about the EU’s lack of willingness and determination to arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement for 2010, says Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs, Lisbeth Berg-Hansen.</p>
<p type="title">Quota for the minke whale hunt in 2010</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[05.12.2009]</p>
<p>The Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs has set a quota of 1286 animals for the minke whale hunt in 2010.</p>

<p type="title">North Atlantic ban on discards in international waters</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[19.11.2009]</p>
<p>The 28th annual meeting of the Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted a ban on discards in international waters on the major stocks regulated by NEAFC. The adoption is a major contribution in the work towards sustainable and responsible management of fisheries in the high seas. NEAFC also adopted several adjustments of the NEAFC Scheme of Control and Enforcement related to port state control, surveillance of fisheries and catch reporting. These are all important tools in the work of combating IUU-fishing.</p>

<p type="title">Norway requests WTO consultations on EU ban on trade in seal products</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[05.11.2009]</p>
<p>Norway has today formally requested WTO dispute settlement consultations, because the Government views the EU ban on trade in seal products as being in contravention of WTO rules. <span type="quote">“In our view, the EU decision is contrary to WTO rules on a number of key points. We will not let this go uncontested. We have therefore requested formal WTO dispute settlement consultations today,”</span> said Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.</p>
<p type="title">Agreement on Norwegian-Russian fisheries for 2010</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[09.10.2009]</p>
<p>Norway and Russia have today entered into an agreement on management of the joint stocks in the Barents Sea for 2010. The stock situation is very good and quotas for both cod and haddock have been increased. The long term collaboration on responsible management, research and control provides great benefits for both Norwegian and Russian fishermen and coastal communities.</p>
<p type="title">New strategy for marine bioprospecting</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[08.09.2009]</p>
<p><span type="quote">“Norway has a long tradition of harvesting the sea and has developed a high level of competence in the marine sector and bioprospecting. Through this new strategy, we are facilitating an exploitation of our marine resources that can provide us with new knowledge and new jobs from the treasure chest of the sea,”</span> said Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Helga Pedersen when she presented the government’s strategy for marine bioprospecting in Tromsø today.</p>
<p type="title">Scotland and Norway sign memorandum</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[17.08.2009]</p>
<p>- Scotland and Norway have signed a Memorandum of Undersanding (MoU) on aquaculture today. - We can learn from each other, and develop our industries even further, says the Norwegian Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Helga Pedersen.</p>
<p xml:lang="tur"></p>
<p type="title">Norwegian fisheries management, our approach on discard of fish</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[07.07.2009]</p>
<p>It is important that the policy of sustainable marine resource management is based on certain key principles: sustainable harvesting, ecosystem approach, adequate regulations and an efficient control and enforcement scheme. These principles are undermined by discard of fish, which is one of the most serious threats to sustainable management.</p>

<p type="title">Overfishing reduced by 84%</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[28.05.2009]</p>
<p><span type="quote">“Once again, overfishing of cod in the Barents Sea has been substantially reduced in 2008. This means that unreported fishing has been reduced by as much as 84% from 2005 to 2008 and that resources to the value of 1.1 billion kroner are now benefiting the coastal communities,”</span> says Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Helga Pedersen.</p>

<p type="title">Norway proposes new international guidelines for by-catch management and discards</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[11.03.2009]</p>
<p>"Up to 20 million tons of fish are discarded in the sea worldwide every year. This is a waste of fish which could have been a valuable food resource. Norway has therefore put forward a proposal on developing international guidelines for by-catch management and reduction of discards to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)," says Norway's Minister for Fisheries and Coastal Affairs, Helga Pedersen.</p>
<p type="title">U-864 is to be raised</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[29.01.2009]</p>
<p>On 29 January the Norwegian Government decided that the wreck of German submarine U 864 is to be raised and the polluted seabed covered by a layer of clean sand and gravel. In 2007 and 2008, the Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA), assisted by Det Norske Veritas, a private company on technical evaluations and risk assessments, undertook a more detailed study of the feasibility of raising the wreck with its cargo of mercury, and compared this measure against that of covering both the wreck and the contaminated seabed. <span type="quote">“This work has identified the different risk factors in the two options. The decision of raising U-864 is the result of an overall evaluation; key aspects in this regard are the identified risks and the concerns that the coastal population and the fishing industry have over a capping of the wreck”</span>, says Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs, Helga Pedersen.</p>

<p type="title">Protective measures for Norwegian coastal cod during 2009</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[19.12.2008]</p>
<p>According to marine scientists, stocks of Norwegian coastal cod have declined since 1994. After a long process, the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs therefore introduced various protective measures to limit the professional fishing of Norwegian coastal cod, effective from 1 May 2004. With some adjustments, these measures have been kept in force from 2005 to 2008. The protective measures will remain in force in 2009 with certain restrictions.</p>
<p type="title">Quota agreement between Norway and the EU for 2009</p>
<p xml:lang="vep">[10.12.2008]</p>
<p>Norway and the EU have concluded a bilateral fisheries agreement for 2009. For both parties discard of fish has been the main issue during this year’s negotiations. Norway and EU have agreed on a number of measures directed at the reduction of discard.</p>
