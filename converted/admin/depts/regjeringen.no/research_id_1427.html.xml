<p type="title">Research</p>
<p>Research is of decisive importance when it comes to ensuring that Norway is a knowledge-based and innovative society. Culture, business and industry and welfare all depend on development and use of research.</p>
<p>Research challenges established perceptions and is necessary if we are to be able to take a stance on new phenomena. Furthermore, research is a pre-requisite for an open and critical social debate and helps us understand ourselves and our surroundings better. New knowledge is a spur to new value creation and innovation. Research strengthens the competitive power of business and industry and is a source of economic growth. Research-based knowledge is becoming increasingly important for solving the challenges that the welfare society is facing in areas such as health, working life and the environment.</p>
