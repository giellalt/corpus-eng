<p type="title">International Law</p>
<p>International law sets out rules governing the rights and obligations of states. Some of these rules are automatically binding on all states (customary international law), but most of them apply only to those states that have expressed that they are willing to be bound by them.</p>
<p>This is done by entering into internationally binding agreements. An overview of the agreements in force for Norway is to be found in the Foreign Ministry treaty database. The Government is seeking to ensure that Norway plays an active part in safeguarding and strengthening the international legal order.</p>
