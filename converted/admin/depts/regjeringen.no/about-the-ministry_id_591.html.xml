    <p><em type="italic">The Ministry of Education and Research is responsible for kindergarten, education and research, sectors important to our growth and development â€“ both as individuals and as a society. </em></p>
    <p>At the same time the kindergardens, educational institutions and the research establishments play important roles as cultural agents and purveyors of culture. Development and change must go hand in hand with conservation and transfer of tradition and values.</p>
    <p>The work of the Ministry is aimed at ensuring that Norway has a sound and well functioning educational system and productive and creative research environments. We need these institutions if we are to meet the challenges in a world where capital and knowledge transcend boundaries, where information technology and biotechnology create new opportunities and ethical challenges, where knowledge is the most important asset.</p>
    <p>The Ministry seeks to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate and influence development in the knowledge society. An important condition for achieving this goal is the existence of a knowledge sector that is able to develop, communicate and exploit new knowledge.</p>
