<p>In connection with the allocation of catch quotas for fish and other marine resources, as well as when otherwise regulation such resources, due regard shall be paid to Saami use of these resources and its importance to local Saami communities.</p>
<p>This shall apply even though this use has been reduced or has ceased due to the fact that catch quotas have not been granted or owing to other regulations of the fisheries or other exploitation of resources in these areas. The same shall apply if the use is reduced or has ceased owing to a reduction of marine resources in these areas.</p>
<p>Article 39</p>

<p>Union concerning the Saami as an indigenous people, Finland undertakes to strengthen the position of Saami reindeer husbandry.</p>
<p>Article 43</p>
<p>Reindeer husbandry across national borders</p>
<p>The right of the Saami to reindeer grazing across national borders is based on custom.</p>
<p>If agreements have been concluded between Saami villages (samebyar), siidas or reindeer grazing communities (renbeteslag) concerning the right to reindeer grazing across national borders, these agreements shall prevail. In the event of dispute concerning the interpretation or application of such an agreement, a party shall have the opportunity to bring the dispute before an arbitration committee for decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the composition of such an arbitration committee and its rules of procedure, the regulation jointly decided by the three Saami parliaments shall apply.</p>
<p>A party who is dissatisfied with the arbitration committee’s decision of the dispute shall have the right to file a suit on the matter in a court of law in the country on which territory the grazing area is situated.</p>
<p>In the absence of an applicable agreement between Saami villages (samebyar), siidas or reindeer grazing communities (renbeteslag), if a valid bilateral treaty regarding reindeer grazing exists, such a treaty shall apply. Notwithstanding any such treaty, shall a person asserting that he or she has a reindeer grazing right based on custom that goes beyond what follows from the bilateral treaty, have the opportunity to have his or her claim tried before a court of law in the country on which territory the grazing area is situated.</p>
