<p type="title">The Queen's Crown</p>
<p>The Queen's Crown was made for Queen Désirée in 1830, although it was first used in 1860 during the coronation of Queen Louise.</p>
<p>The Queen's crown was fashioned by Erik Lundberg and Marc Giron in Stockholm for the planned coronation in 1830 of Queen Désirée, wife of King Carl Johan, who was not crowned alongside her husband in 1818. However, the coronation of Queen Désirée never took place, and the Queens Crown was first used in 1860 during the coronation of Queen Louise.</p>
