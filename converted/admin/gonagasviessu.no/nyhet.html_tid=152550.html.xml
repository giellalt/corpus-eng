<p type="title">State Visit from Iceland</p>
<p>His Majesty The King received His Excellency President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson and his wife Ms Eliza Reid in the Palace Square today. The President and First Lady of Iceland are conducting a three-day State Visit to Norway.</p>

<p>Her Majesty The Queen and Their Royal Highnesses The Crown Prince and Crown Princess were also in attendance to welcome the Icelandic president and his wife. This marks the third State Visit from Iceland during King Harald’s reign. Mr Ólafur R. Grimsson and Ms Vigdis Finnbogadóttir visited Norway during their terms as president, in 1997 and 1992 respectively.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, the visit will strengthen the excellent ties between Iceland and Norway by focusing on the countries’ shared cultural heritage and ways to further develop cooperation in the areas of culture, education, research and innovation.</p>

<p>Norwegian Literature Abroad (NORLA) promotes the export of Norwegian literature and is in charge of planning the Norwegian programme for the 2019 Frankfurt Book Fair. NORLA hired Icelandic Halldór Gudmundsson to serve as project manager for the process leading up to 2019. Mr Gudmundsson headed the initiative when Iceland was the Guest of Honour in 2011, and therefore has unique expertise and experience. Together with the Director of NORLA, Ms Margit Walsø, he presented the project to the King and Queen and the President and First Lady. Crown Princess Mette-Marit, who has a keen interest in literature, was also in attendance.</p>
