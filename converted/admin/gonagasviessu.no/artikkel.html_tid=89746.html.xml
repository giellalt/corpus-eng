<p type="title">Focus: World Economic Forum</p>
<p>The Crown Princess became a member of Young Global Leaders (YGL), a forum under the World Economic Forum, in 2010. In summer 2012 she was invited to join the board of the Global Shapers Community, the World Economic Forum’s network for the youngest leaders.</p>
<p>In her capacity as a YGL, the Crown Princess attends the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos each January. She also attends regional YGL meetings around the world. The Forum of Young Global Leaders comprises leaders under the age of 40 representing the business, political and cultural spheres, non-governmental organisations and public authorities.</p>
<p type="title">Global Shapers</p>
<p>In 2012 the World Economic Forum launched a new network for leaders between the ages of 20 and 30. The community was established in response to the fact that over one-half of the world’s population is under the age of 27, making it more important than ever that the voices of young people are heard.</p>
<p>Global Shapers Hubs have been established in cities around the world, each with a Young Global Leader as mentor. The Crown Princess is the Founding Curator for Global Shapers Oslo and mentor to a group of young leaders in various sectors. In august 2012 the Crown Princess became a member of the Foundation Board of the Global Shapers Community.</p>
