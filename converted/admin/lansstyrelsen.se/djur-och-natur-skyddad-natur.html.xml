<p type="title">Protected nature</p>
<p>Photo: Maria Jons.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to protect nature, and in accordance with the Swedish Environmental Code, the County Administrative Board has set up nature reserves and bird sanctuaries. We are also responsible for the care and management of nature reserves, national parks and hiking trails in the mountains.</p>
<p type="title">National parks are the strongest form of protection</p>
<p>A national park is a large, connected area of a certain type of landscape that is protected in its natural state. National parks are the strongest form of protection.</p>
<p type="title">Nature and cultural reserves have many purposes</p>
<p>Nature reserves are the most common form of protected natural areas, and they can be created to conserve biodiversity, for maintaining and preserving valuable natural environments or to meet the need of areas for outdoor recreation. Culture reserves are a similar form of protection, and such may be formed to protect valuable cultural landscape areas</p>
<p type="title">Natura 2000 available across the EU</p>
<p>Natura 2000 is a network of valuable natural areas within the EU. The purpose is to protect species and habitats that are of common interest to EU countries.</p>
<p type="title">Nature has more forms of protection</p>
<p>Other current forms of protection are, for example, animal and plant protection areas, shoreline areas, water protection areas, natural heritage and habitat protection areas.</p>
<p type="title">Protected areas are managed in different ways</p>
<p>The County Administrative Board manages the majority of the county's environment protection items, but the administration can also be operated by municipalities, foundations and the Swedish Forest Agency.</p>
<p type="title">Summer and winter mountain trails are important</p>
<p>The County Administrative Board also manages large areas of state land in the mountains, and we are responsible for the state trails with bridges, shelters, and for the marking of summer and winter trails. The trails are important for mountain safety and so that visitors do not damage sensitive areas.</p>
