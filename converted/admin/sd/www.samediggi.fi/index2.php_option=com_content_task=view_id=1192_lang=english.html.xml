    <p>The Youth Council of the Sámi parliament has started the Oahppoofelaš-project concerning the employment situation in Sápmi region in Finland in the future. The project aims to investigate holistically which kind of jobs are and will be available in the future in Sápmi. In addition to this we want to discuss in which jobs there is need for Sámi speaking employees and in which kind of jobs telecommuting is possible.</p>
    <p>Research will be conducted by using electronic survey and interviews, and based on the results got from the survey and interviews we will design an Oahppoofelaš brochure for young people. This brochure consist of information about the employment opportunities for young people if they want to work and stay in Sápmi also after their graduation. We will soon contact the employers in the Sápmi region in Finland concerning our survey and we thank all for your co-operation.</p>
