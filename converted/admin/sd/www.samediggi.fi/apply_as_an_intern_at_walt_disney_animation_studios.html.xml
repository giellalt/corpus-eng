<p>– We are pleased that this unique opportunity will present itself in 2021, either digitally or locally at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Los Angeles. Many good applications were received from Sápmi last year, but due to Covid-19, the internship scheme in 2020 was postponed. We therefore hope that those who had applied last year will consider applying again. We are happy to be able to contribute to a very exciting exchange opportunity, says Aili Keskitalo (President of the Sámi Parliament in Norway), Tuomas Aslak Juuso (President of the Sámi Parliament in Finland), Per-Olof Nutti (President of the Sámi Parliament in Sweden) and Åsa Larsson-Blind (Vice President of the Sámi Council) in a joint statement.</p>
