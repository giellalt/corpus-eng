<list><p type="listitem">always stay with the child when it is taking a bath or playing near water to avoid drowning accidents</p>
<p type="listitem">remember that large puddles, water-filled ditches, bird baths and small ponds can also pose a drowning hazard for a small child</p>

</list><p>There are rules for how swimming pools and other kinds of pools must be covered or enclosed to prevent accidents. According to the Swedish Consumer Agency, swimming pools, pools, shallow ponds and garden ponds should be enclosed and have child-proof locks.</p>
<p type="title">To reduce risks when driving or cycling:</p>
<list><p type="listitem">use an approved child car seat that is installed facing backwards</p>
<p type="listitem">from age four to five, use a booster seat or booster cushion</p>

<p type="listitem">use bike helmets, child seats and spoke guards if you take your child on your bike</p>
<p type="listitem">do not let your child ride a two-wheeled bike until he or she is five years old. The child is not mature enough until then. If you use training wheels the child can achieve speeds that it cannot control, which is a significant accident hazard</p>
<p type="listitem">make sure that children up to seven years old use a bicycle helmet with a green chin strap that opens when subjected to a certain load. In Sweden the law stipulates that children under 15 must wear a helmet when they ride a bike</p>
<p type="listitem">use reflectors</p>
<p type="listitem">practise how to behave in traffic</p>
</list><p>It is good if the child can use a rearward-facing child car seat for as long as possible. The child has grown out of the seat when the seat back is level with the top of the child's ears, or when the seat's recommended user weight has been exceeded.</p>
<p type="title">To prevent other accidents</p>
<p>To prevent other accidents you can regularly check the child's equipment and toys, for example the brakes on the pram and the rubber teats on dummies.</p>
<p type="title">Passive smoking</p>
<p>Passive smoking exposes the child to health risks. If you cannot stop smoking completely, change your smoking habits and stop smoking at home. A completely smoke-free environment is best for the child.</p>
