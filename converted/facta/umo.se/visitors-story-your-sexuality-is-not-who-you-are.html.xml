<p>Visitor's story: Your sexuality isn't you</p>
<p type="title">Visitor's story: Your sexuality isn't you</p>
<p>Your sexuality is not who you are. It is what you are. Being gay doesn’t make you <span type="quote">“feminine”</span> and being a lesbian doesn’t make you <span type="quote">“masculine”</span>. Being straight doesn’t make you <span type="quote">“normal”</span> or <span type="quote">“normally feminine or masculine”</span>.</p>
<p>Who I want to have sex with has nothing to do with the clothes I wear or who I am. It has nothing to do with my family. Maybe I have a normal family, maybe I’m a normal girl who happens to like sleeping both with girls and guys. I get so fed up with people who make a big thing out of it, who whisper behind my back and spread rumours. Who make judgements about whether I’m more masculine or feminine. About whether I’m normal. I’ m just like you, I’m not a green alien. Accept that and try to understand that this is not a big thing! There are more of us than you think, it’s more common than you think.</p>
