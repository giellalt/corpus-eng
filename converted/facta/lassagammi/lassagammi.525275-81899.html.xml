<p>Lásságámmi was Nils-Aslak Valkeapää’s own name for the house he had built on the lot he got as a fiftieth birthday present from Storfjord municipality. The lot lies on a sloping rock, and the house was intended to resemble a large turf hut – hence, the name that literally translated means <span type="quote">“the sloping rock turf hut.”</span> Lásságámmi is also the name of the foundation that administers the rights to his creative output. The foundation was established in 2004 and is owned by the Sámi Parliament in Norway, Storfjord municipality, the county of Troms and the University of Tromsø.</p>
<p>The foundation’s purpose is to administer the legacy of Nils-Aslak Valkeapää in the spirit and philosophy that comes to light in his works and publications. When Nils-Aslak died, the county of Troms and the Norwegian Ministry of Culture provided the means for the newly established foundation to buy Lásságámmi, and begin the work of turning it into a residence for researchers and artists. The foundation manages the rights to Valkeapää’s artistic production.</p>
<p>By allowing selected persons to live and work on their own art and research projects in Nils-Aslak’s house, the foundation wants to encourage the occupants to carry on in their professional and artistic development. The dwelling is in principle kept as Nils-Aslak Valkeapää left it. A separate committee, named by the board of the foundation, selects who will be able to live in the house for shorter or longer periods. In between these periods, the house will be open for visits by the public at specific times.</p>
