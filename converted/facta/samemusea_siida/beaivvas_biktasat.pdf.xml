    <p>Preface</p>
    <p>The first spark of interest to organize an exhibition displaying the theatre costumes of Beaivváš Sámi National Theatre kindled in spring 2008 when Beaivváš performed Nils-Aslak Valkeapää’s play <em type="italic">The Frost Haired and the Dream-seer</em> at the Oulu City Theatre. The costumes used in the play formed an impressive combination of the designs of traditional Sámi costumes and Japanese kimonos. The costumes shimmered with rich colours and appeared to be made out of heavy and expensive silk, the kind of fabric one would imagine to be used in an emperor’s court. The main character, the Frost Haired, had in the front of his costume a figure of a bear, embroidered with leather strips, taking one’s thoughts to the old bear mythology of the Sámi. For a short moment, the performance opened up a view into the heart of the verbal and visual world of the Sámi, into the heart of theatre art. The costume exhibition at the Siida Sámi Museum presents an overview of the significance of the theatre as a visual form of art, in which the costume designer acts as a mediator between the theatre performance and the audience. </p>
    <p> Sigga-Marja Magga A  group  of  young  idealists  formed  a theatre company called Beaivváš in the winter of 1980–1981. Their aim was to produce one play, the ”rock-yoik opera” <em type="italic">Min duoddarat</em> (Our Highlands) as an artistic uptake on the then ongoing dispute  about  the  harnessing  of  the Alta  River  for  energy  production.  In the same way as the political strife, the play united ”us” and gave like-minded people a sense of solidarity and com<em type="italic">Min</em>  <em type="italic">duoddarat</em>  were  made  (1981  and 1983),  establishing  the  group  of  per<em type="italic">proveperiod</em>) to see whether  Beaivváš  would  qualify  as  a kind of regional theatre. In terms of art, the  1980s  presented  a  productive  pe<em type="italic">Min duoddarat</em>  that  was  partly  performed in two languages, Beaivváš also paid at<em type="italic">Vaikko čuođi stálu</em> (Even if a Hundred Ogres… 1985 and 1994– 1995) depicted a thousand years of Sámi history, relying on the oral tradition and mythical characters. The musical <em type="italic">Luohti gomuvuođa  salas</em>  (A  Yoik  Nestled  in Infinity 1988) was based on the music skills of the Sámi (starring Mari Boine Persen)  and  on  a  spectacular  dance performance  in  a  visually  impressive setting.  The  children’s  play  <em type="italic">Máidnasat</em> rendering of a traditional tale to a new environment, outdoors on an icy lake. It was a presage of how the use of natural settings  was  to  become  a  key  compomunity.  At  the  same  time,  the  Sámi were able to prove their strength also on stage, by means of an art form that was novel to them. Two  successful  versions  of  the  play formers  as  a  theatre  company  and making it possible for them to produce a host of new plays. The theatre company  was  awarded  regular  state  fundcalled trial period (riod that was characterized by a search for <span type="quote" xml:lang="sme">”Sámi drama”</span>, the most appropriate forms of expression in art for the Sámi. The primary aim of Beaivváš was to strengthen the Sámi language and identity  but,  as  in  the  production  of  tention to its non-Sámi audience in its attempts to convince decision-makers of the necessity and proficiency of the theatre  company.  Music  provided  an obvious starting point simply because many of the actors had a background in music. Another point of departure was a pursuit of visuality, rather than drama dialogue. Initially,  the  development  of  an  appropriate form of theatrical expression was based on the ideal that only materials produced by the Sámi themselves could convey what it means to be Sámi. For example, nent in the visual imagery of Beaivváš. By the end of 1990, the theatre had produced 19 plays in total. </p>
    <p><em type="bold">Hamlet in a theatre of ice</em> </p>
    <p>In  1991,  the  state  of  Norway  began  to support  Beaivváš  financially  as  a  permanent theatre (<em type="italic">fast teater</em>) and, a little later,  Beaivváš  was  awarded  the  status of a national institution in Norway, al<em type="italic">Varraheajat</em> (Blood Wedding, 1989) was a pioneer: it presented a version of Federico Garbeit  the  funding  that  it  received  never reached  the  level  of  even  the  smallest Norwegian  regional  theatres.  The  establishment  of  a  full-time  directorship reflected the growing professionalism of the theatre, leading to a sharp increase in the amount of productions. In the following 15 years, Beaivváš had a total of 59  premieres—three  times  the  amount that it produced in its first ten years. The increase in the amount of productions was one explanation for why Beaivváš began to gain a more diverse appearance.  Sámi  themes  were  no longer  enough,  and  Beaivváš  began to  produce  various  drama  classics, from  Bertolt  Brecht  to  Anton  Chekhov.  Harriet  Nordlund’s  cia Lorca’s classic that was only mildly adapted to the Sámi environment. </p>
    <p>from other parts of the world, too. In <em type="italic">Narukámi</em>  (1991),  director  Haukur  J. Gunnarsson  brought  together  Japa<em type="italic">Boaresbártnit</em>  (Batchelors  1995)  that  dealt  with the  relationships  between  men  and women by means of Japanese popular comedy  and  Sámi  storytelling.  Japa<em type="italic">Ridn’oaivi ja nieguid oaidni</em> (The Frost Haired and the Dream-seer 2007) and <em type="italic">Nikio</em> (2008). In the 1990s, the visual appearance of Beaivváš was also increasingly shaped by the setting that was provided by its northern surroundings, i.e. the use of natural  settings  as  an  important  part of set design and even of the dramatic development of a play. A joint produc<em type="italic">Sezuan</em>  (The  Good  Person  of Szechwan)  by  several  theatres  in  the North  was  performed  in  a  theatre  of ice, setting Bertolt Brecht’s critical renese drama and Sámi actors to create a new form of visual expression that was characterized  by  stylized  movement and pantomime. In the same vein, Nordlund directed a version of nese influence has later been strongly present in, for instance, the production of the plays tion  of  flection on the wretchedness of people into an arctic community and into the harsh cold. Artist Aage Gaup designed a  stage  setting  of  ice,  parts  of  which had already sunk before the performance could be finalized. In plays written by Sámi, the juxtaposition of the Sámi and the majority population  were  gradually  set  aside. </p>
    <p>within  the  Sámi  community.  Inger Margrethe  Olsen’s  plays,  for  example, often addressed sensitive issues of the Sámi  community,  such  as  prejudice against  homosexuality  (<em type="italic">Earalágan</em>  - Different 1992), or the mechanisms of violence (<em type="italic">Skoavdnji</em> - Bogey 1994). History  became  another  focus  of Sámi  writers’  literary  production  in the 1990s. Their plays explored the his<em type="italic">Gumpegoddi</em> - Wolf Hunter, <em type="italic">Prinsen of Lappland</em> - Prince of Lapland, Okto - Alone), political history (<em type="italic">Eatni váibmu vardá</em>  –  The  Mother’s  Heart  Bleeds), the impacts of war on the Sámi com<em type="italic">Kiögg kå´kke / Giegat guhkket</em> - Cuckoos Call 1994) or the traumatic recent past of the Sámi (<em type="italic">Internáhtta</em> – Dormitory  2003).  Additionally,  there were cabarets, which were particularly common  during  Alex  Scherpf’s  term as  director.  The  cabaret  <em type="italic">Giđđadulvi</em> (Spring  Flood)  became  a  popular  se<em type="italic">Vølundda  muitalus</em>  (The  Lay  of  Vol<em type="italic">Macbeth</em>  and  later  <em type="italic">Hamlet</em>  on  a  stage of Lake Jukkasjärvi.

Theatrical  performances  involving snow  and  ice  became  even  more  of a  trademark  for  the  Sámi  theatre  as und,  2000)  continued  the  series  of monumental  outdoor  performances. The zenith of such development can be considered  to  be  the  collaborative  efforts of Beaivváš and the Sámi theatre in Kiruna that presented Shakespeare’s ing to Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre. Outstanding works in world literature were subjected to various adaptations in the 1990s. In addition to adaptations of texts by Anton Chekhov, Nikolai Gogol and F. G. Lorca, Beaivváš drew on the Bible to present Job, who complained to a  (female!)  God  about  his  troubles,  as well as on Ludvig Holberg to introduce the  drunkard  Jeppe,  whose  misadventures seemed to be written for the grand old  man  of  Sámi  actors,  Nils  Utsi,  as his bravura pieces. J. W. Goethe’s ment with the help of visually impressive costume and set design. Under  Scherp’s  direction,  Shakespeare’s  characters  from  Romeo  and Juliet to Macbeth dashed onto the Sámi stage — as clowns! Instead of the Capulet and Montague families, Sámi sports clubs faced each other in mortal battle, or at least tried to: the battle was distracted by the fact that the opponents were clowns who wore silly costumes, moved jerkily, spoke with a shrill voice and made vain attempts at hitting one another.  Once  again,  Beaivváš  was contested in the press: what was appropriate for Sámi theatre? The  literary  classics  were  counterbalanced by <span type="quote">”authentic”</span> forms of Sámi theatre,  musicals  that  were  largely based  on  the  works  of  well-known </p>
    <p>techno  and  didgeridoos  with  synthesizers; produced yoik and dance concerts  under  the  northern  lights  and brought  music  into  pubs  and  cafés. Another long-standing genre was children’s  plays  in  which  the  Sámi  tradition of fairy tales and stories continued to have a firm hold. The myths of other indigenous  peoples  were  also  drawn upon,  for  example,  in  the  play  <em type="italic">Allaq</em> (2010) written by Cecilia Persson. </p>
    <p><em type="bold">Polyphony of influences</em> </p>
    <p>It is possible to detect in the development of Beaivváš features that are also characteristic  to  other  forms  of  Sámi art. The first decade presented a phase of nationality during which the topics and themes were to a great extent tied together with the development of a national  identity.  The  contrast  between <span type="quote">”us” and ”the others”</span> ran through the plays. Theatre, among other things, set a scene for struggles concerning Sámi identity and self-image. Nevertheless,  drama,  by  its  nature, speaks  with  many  voices.  Theatre workers  see  themselves  as  heirs  to  a lively storytelling tradition. In addition to the Sámi background, Beaivváš has gathered  strength  in  world  literature, theatre traditions of indigenous peoples and  oriental  drama.  Multiculturalism has been present in the theatre’s staff, which has included members of Sámi origin who have come from across the the majority population. Beaivváš Sámi National Theatre has always addressed two audiences. It has attracted both Sámi and non-Sámi audiences, spectators who know Sámi as well as those who do not understand the language spoken on stage but who can  nonetheless  empathize  with  the emotional  atmosphere  of  a  play.  This double communication has been necessary because the theatre has been faced with the task of not only constructing Sámi identity but also influencing the image that outsiders have of the Sámi. A more practical aim has been to convince decision-makers of the necessity of a Sámi theatre. Throughout its history, Beaivváš Sámi National  Theatre  has  had  to  struggle with challenges of a small institutionalized theatre. The financial support provided by the state is barely enough for the production of 2–3 premieres a year and for the running of a tour. Only 4–5 actors have a permanent contract with the  theatre,  and  it  is  hard  to  organize enough  training  for  them.  The  theatre has difficulties in getting young people interested  in  theatre  and  in  recruiting new  actors.  Nevertheless,  the  theatre should be able to develop, to uphold a lively and interactive connection to the audience. Especially in the case of young spectators, the theatre has to compete with many influential forms of art, such as documentary films at present. Beaivváš Along with staging and lighting, theatre costumes form an integral part of the visual narrative of theatre that underscores the time and place in which the play is set as well as the disposition of the characters. Theatre costumes may be inconspicuous so that spectators do not pay any special attention to them. In a sense, they may then blend in with the setting, although every single garment in a play is usually chosen with great care and a particular purpose in mind. Theatre costumes may also stand out and sometimes even steal the show, so that visual storytelling takes precedence over verbal drama. At their best, however,  theatre  costumes  carry  the spectators into the depths of the story and lead them into the inner world of the characters in the play. Theatre costumes are an illusion. A costume may not necessarily be what it seems to be in the eyes of the audience. The glimmer and glitter may not</p>
    <p>with golden threads, but in quite ordinary materials that turn into diamonds and spangles when caught in a certain light. A shimmering silver crown may be  made  out  of  silver-painted  door handles,  as  was  the  elder’s  crown  in the  play  Allaq.  It  may  also  seem  that putting on an impressive, voluminous costume takes a lot of time, but it may in effect be put on with one pull of a zipper. An actor may have many roles in one play and the costumes may differ  greatly  from  one  role  to  another. There  may  thus  be  another  performance taking place behind the stage, as costumers  and  their  assistants  dress and undress actors during a play. Many  theatres  struggle  with  financial issues and visuality has to give way to economy. On the other hand, that is characteristic of theatre because theatre is the art of passing moments . Every play is  a  unique  event  although  the  details have  been  polished  to  create  an  effective whole. Creativity in coming up with technical  solutions  also  gives  freedom and  forms  part  of  the  theatre’s  charm; how easy it all seems and how extremely inventive theatre workers can be. Beaivváš  Sámi  National  Theatre  is known  for  its  impressive  and  appealing theatre costumes, which have been created  by  costume  designer  Berit Marit  Hætta.  She  is  a  <em type="italic">duojár</em>  (Sámi craftsmaker),  an  artist,  an  illustrator and  a  designer  of  theatre  costumes. Since 1980, Hætta has illustrated doz<em type="italic">The Lay of Volund</em>. schoolbooks and collections of poems; designed  covers  and  produced  other graphic  materials.  She  has  worked as  a  freelance  costume  designer  for Beaivváš Sámi Teahter since 1993. She has  also  designed  theatre  costumes for  Hålogaland  Theatre,  the  regional theatre in Tromsø. In 2000, Berit Marit Hætta and sculptor, set designer Aage Gaup  received  the  Hedda  Award,  the Norwegian theatre award, for best costume  and  set  design,  for  their  work in the Beaivváš Sámi Teahter outdoor production </p>
    <p>Beaivváš  Sámi  National  Theatre  finds its  inspiration  not  only  in  the  Sámi culture but also in the cultures of other indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities. Nonetheless, traditional Sámi clothing forms the foundation of costume design for Beaivváš. Through the use of costumes, classic drama can be transferred into a Sámi setting or, vice versa, Sámi themes can be set in countries far away, even beyond dreams. The costume  designer  is  involved  in  the production  of  a  play  throughout  the process. She acquaints herself with the script and constructs the mood of the play and the disposition of the characters together with the director, set designer, lighting designer and costume maker.  Costumes  develop  into  their final form during the rehearsals, where the functionality of the costumes is put into test when they are actually worn by the actors, and when viewed in relation to the setting. The  ways  in  which  Sámi  garments are designed and cut date back to times when  clothing  materials  consisted mainly of reindeer skin in its different forms. The same patterns and cuts that were used when winter garments were still made out of reindeer hide are now used in garments that are made out of woven fabric and are known as the traditional Sámi costume, gákti. The Sámi clothing tradition has not broken off at any point in history but has carried over centuries, simply taking on new forms.</p>
    <p>and reindeer leg skins determines how they  are  best  cut  to  make  fur  coats, gaiters  and  shoes.  In  former  times, and also today, the cut and sewing is measured by spans and by the eye because every material and every piece of clothing is unique. Berit Marit Hætta says that as a duojár she feels that it is own designs. In this way, she is able to make sure that every costume is feasible in practice. It is also important that the costume makers and the designer have  a  common  understanding  of  a costume at all stages of its production. Sámi  garments  have  been  made  for everyday  and  work  use  and,  because of their practicality, they form a sound basis for theatre costumes. It is easy to make the back, front or sleeves of a fur coat  or  a  gákti  wider  or  narrower  to fit  an  actor’s  build.  Performances  that contain a lot of moving about or dancing call for light, loose and breathable costumes. Plays that are performed in a theatre of ice make it necessary that the costumes used are warm and waterrepellent, and that enough many thermal layers can be worn under the outer garments. For instance, the play <em type="italic">Hamlet</em> was performed outdoors in mid-winter, when the temperature dropped to near<em type="italic">The  Frost  Haired  and  the  Dreamseer</em>,  in  which  the  costumes  were  de<em type="italic">Hamlet</em>,  in  which  the  costumes  were used to set the story in Mongolia. In<em type="italic">Hamlet</em>, Hætta set the themes of malice and violence as far away from the Sámi as possible, all the way to Asia.  ly -30 Celsius degrees, so the costumes had to be well insulated. In addition to their practicality, Sámi garments are easily adaptable to other cultures,  as  Berit  Marit  Hætta  points out. Good examples of that adaptability are  signed  to  fit  Japanese  culture,  and deed, theatre costumes gain even more meaning when considered in the light of the dual purpose that Beaivváš Theaginning, the aim of the Sámi theatre has been to strengthen Sámi language and identity, with an additional aim of informing others about the Sámi culture and  mindset.  In  using  the  Sámi  language,  Beaivváš  has  acquainted  Sámi with  various  theatre  traditions  from across the world, such as the European and Japanese traditions. In using strong visual imagery, it has created a form of expression  that  appeals  also  to  those who do not understand Sámi. According  to  Berit  Marit  Hætta, adapting  classic  drama  to  the  Sámi culture  is  easier  than  one  would  first imagine.  Classics  in  world  literature and drama usually deal with universal human themes and emotions, such as love and hate, that are common to all cultures and touch people all over the world. Sometimes the themes of a play deal with topics that may seem foreign to the costume designer, in which case it may be better to set the events away from  Sámi  culture.  For  example,  in </p>
    <p><em type="bold">Costumes comment and communicate</em> </p>
    <p>Theatre-goers observe the performance, movement and dialogue of the actors as well as the functioning of the set design. Even if they would not understand a word of the language spoken in hize with the characters. The costumes used  in  a  theatre  performance  may help in interpreting the main story, or they may narrate a story of their own. Stories  told  by  the  costumes  may,  for example, comment on the problems of poverty, as can be seen in the costumes of the play <em type="italic">Allaq</em>. Berit  Marit  Hætta  reports  how  the costumes  of  the  characters  in  <em type="italic">Allaq</em> were sometimes criticized for being so clean and decorative although the story was set after a natural disaster and the characters had lost everything that they had had. Hætta tells that on her travels  across  the  world  she  also  visited  countries  in  great  material  need. She  noticed  that  people  nonetheless wanted to dress well and wear beautiful clothes, so as to show that they were not giving into poverty although there was not much that they could do about it. What they could do was to maintain their dignity and pride, their only possessions in extreme poverty. Sometimes  Sámi  craftspeople  may come to see a performance simply to wonder at the new creations of the costume designer. Their interest is based on the fact that Berit Marit Hætta has the  ability  to  design  costumes  that highlight distinct elements of different cultures  and  make  them  visible  even to those sitting on the back row of the auditorium. The impact of theatre on the  development  of  the  Sámi  culture is indisputable. It has especially influSámi youth. The costumes of Beaivváš Sámi Teahter, which draw extensively on the cultures of other arctic peoples, can  be  considered  a  form  of  art  that unites indigenous peoples. The theatre mediates  between  different  cultures and  encourages  people  to  learn  from one  another,  develop  themselves  and sometimes  even  distance  themselves from their traditions. Berit  Marit  Hætta  is  of  the  opinion that young people have found the courage to play with different materials and designs. They are increasingly testing  the  boundaries  between  tradition and  modernity.  She  notes,  however, that  the  cultural  heritage  of  the  Sámi is  such  that  it  cannot  be  mixed  with our  illusions.  That  heritage  is  fragile and  vulnerable  to  outside  influences and should therefore be cherished with care.  On  the  other  hand,  she  admits that  the  theatre  is  free  to  paint  new landscapes  and  create  new  images  of our culture and, therefore, it also has the  possibility  to  provide  us  with  alternative interpretations of the reality around us. </p>
