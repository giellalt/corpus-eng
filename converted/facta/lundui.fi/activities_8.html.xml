    <p type="title">Activities in Pöyrisjärvi Wilderness Area</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p type="title">What can one do in Pöyrisjärvi Wilderness Area?</p>
    <p type="title">Walk on Marked Trails</p>
    <p>There are no marked hiking trails within the wilderness area, but there are many old well worn paths. They were used as a postal route at the beginning of the 20th Century. There is a marked trail which passes just outside the boundary of the area.</p>
    <p type="title">Go Canoeing and Rowing</p>
    <p>Pöyrisjärvi Wilderness Area offers wonderful possibilities for canoeing. The River Pöyrisjoki, which has its source at Lake Pöyrisjärvi, and the River Käkkälöjoki are both excellent canoeing routes.</p>
    <p type="title">See the Nature Centre</p>
    <p>The centre of the municipality of Enontekiö, Hetta, is located south of the wilderness area. Fell-Lapland Nature Centre, a Metsähallitus customer service centre, in turn is located in Hetta. The nature centre provides information on the wilderness area and is where visitors can reserve the wilderness area's reservable wilderness huts.</p>
    <p type="title">Ski Cross-country off Trails</p>
    <p>Skiing is permitted all over the wilderness area, but there are no maintained or marked ski trails.</p>
    <p type="title">Go Fishing</p>
    <p>Angling and ice fishing are Everyman's Rights (www.ymparisto.fi) in the wilderness area. You can therefore practice them without having a permit. Angling with worm bait and ice fishing are forbidden in flowing waters. To fish in the wilderness area's multiple rivers you must have paid the national fishing management fee (www.eraluvat.fi) as well as have a Metsähallitus recreational fishing licence (Enontekiö 1551 permit , www.eraluvat.fi). Fishing permits are sold by Fell-Lapland Nature Centre, other Metsähallitus customer service points and local tourist enterprises.</p>
    <p>The River Pöyrisjoki and several other rivers in the wilderness area are ideal for fly and lure fishing. Common catches from the river include the Whitefish <em type="italic">(Goregonus lavaretus), </em>Pike <em type="italic">(Esox lucius), </em>Perch <em type="italic">(Perca fluviatilis) </em>and Burbot <em type="italic">(Lota lota), </em>as well as, the Grayling <em type="italic">(Thymallus thymallus) </em>and Trout <em type="italic">(Salmo trutta). </em>These same species can be found in Lake Pöyrisjärvi. The lake's dominant species is the Whitefish, which can weigh from 200 to 300 grams per fish. </p>
    <p type="title">Go Cycling</p>
    <p>There are no marked biking trails in Pöyrisjärvi Wilderness Area, but there are paths, which can be used both for hiking and mountain biking. These paths are extremely demanding and those attempting them with mountain bikes should have a map and compass with them.</p>
    <p type="title">Go on Guided Group Tour at the Nature Centre and Outdoors</p>
    <p>Tourist enterprises in the Enontekiö area (e.g. in the villages of Näkkälä and Nunnanen) organise guided tours in the wilderness area. For further information on tours go to the Enontekiö website (www.enontekio.fi).</p>
    <p>Its possible to get a tour of the exhibition at Fell-Lapland Nature Centre . The nature centre is located in the village of Hetta.</p>
    <p type="title">Go Hunting</p>
    <p>To hunt in Pöyrisjärvi Wilderness Area you will have to purchase permit to 1615 Näkkälä or permit to 1616 Nunnanen. Local game animals include the Willow Grouse, the hare and water birds. Hunting permits are sold by Fell-Lapland Nature Centre .</p>
    <p>A limited number of small game permits are sold for a day at a time. With these permits non-locals can hunt in the area. Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood in the area, so the use of hounds is strictly forbidden even if you have a permit. In late winter those hunting with dogs must ask the reindeer herding groups where there herds are so the hunt can keep away from them.</p>
    <p>Permanent residents of the municipalities of Enontekiö, Inari and Utsjoki have the right to hunt on state-owned lands in the municipality in which they reside. Locals also have the right to hunt the Willow Grouse <em type="italic">(Lagopus lagopus) </em>with traps. The Willow Grouse is an important source of income for many Enontekiö families. </p>
    <p type="title">Go Berry and Mushroom Picking</p>
    <p>Picking berries and mushrooms is permitted in the area. The most popular berry for people to pick is the cloudberry <em type="italic">(Rubus chamaemorus) </em>, which grows in late summer early autumn in the area's mires. The blueberry <em type="italic">(Vaccinium myrtillus) </em>and lingonberry <em type="italic">(Vaccinium vitis-idaea) </em>thrive in the southern part of the area and crowberries <em type="italic">(Empetrum nigrum) </em>grow even on the area's sandy dunes. The forested parts of the wilderness area offer basketfuls of mushrooms. Even though mushrooms are a favourite food of reindeer there is such an abundance of them that great amounts are left in the forests to rot. </p>
