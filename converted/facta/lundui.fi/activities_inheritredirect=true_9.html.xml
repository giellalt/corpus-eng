<p type="title">Activities in Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area</p>
<p></p>

<p type="title">What can one do in Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area?</p>
<p type="title">Go Hiking</p>
<p>There are no marked hiking trails in the area, but the landscape is ideal for trekking. In the middle and the northern parts of the wilderness area, the terrain is not difficult, due to it mostly being fell heaths. The brooks and rivers are fast-flowing but shallow, so they can usually be waded across. Only the rivers Kielajoki and Peltojoki are difficult to cross in the downstream. However, a wilderness area is always a demanding hiking destination where experience is needed.</p>
<p type="title">See the Sights and Scenery</p>
<p>The sharp inclined <em type="italic">Kuárvikozzâ, </em>the highest fell in the wilderness area, can be seen silhouetted against the sky, standing out among the rounded felltops. The best way to get to the top is from the northwest or the southeast, because the southern slope is steep. There is a lot of scree on the upper parts of the fell. The scenery from the top is considered to be one of the most beautiful in Lapland. </p>
<p>The large, fjord-like <em type="italic">Lake Peltojärvi </em>is a jewel of the wilderness, among the fells in the eastern part of the area. The lake is about 6 km long. To see this treasure, a hiker needs to make the effort to get through the dense birch forest on the shore - or then to admire it further from the fells. The Peltotunturi Fell next to the lake is the best place to see it. </p>
<p>The sides of <em type="italic">Stuorrâävži Ravine </em>rise about 100 above the bottom of the ravine. The valley is 10 km long. At its deepest and narrowest it is in the middle. On the bottom, there are several small lakes, which shine like a string of pearls in the middle of the mountain birch forest. </p>
<p type="title">Ski Cross-country off Trails</p>
<p>In the snowy wilderness, you can ski wherever you like. There are no marked skiing trails.</p>
<p type="title">Go Fishing</p>
<p>Muotkatunturi area is an excellent destination to go fishing. Most likely you will catch Grayling <em type="italic">(Thymallus thymallus), </em>Trout <em type="italic">(Salmo trutta), </em>Whitefish <em type="italic">(Goregonus lavaretus), </em>Pike <em type="italic">(Esox lucius) </em>or Perch <em type="italic">(Perca fluviatilis). </em>The fell lakes are good fishing places. There are lots of fish in the Lake Peltojärvi - although the lake is so deep that it is not easy to catch the fish. Other good fishing spots you will find along the rivers which flow into the River Vaskojoki. </p>
<p>Angling and ice fishing are allowed without a permit. There are no special waters in the wilderness where the Everyman's right would be restricted. For other methods of fishing, except angling and ice fishing, people who are 18 - 64 years old need to pay the fishing management fee (www.eraluvat.fi) and to buy the appropriate fishing permit. Most of the brooks, rivers and lakes in the municipalities of Inari and Utsjoki are covered by the Inari fishing area permit no 1564.</p>
<p>The permits can be bought from Metsähallitus netstore (www.eräluvat.fi), at Metsähallitus Customer Service in Ivalo and at Siida - Northern Lapland Nature Centre in Inari. <em type="italic">The salmon parasite </em><em type="italic">(Gyrodactylus salaris) </em>has not yet spread to the valuable salmon rivers flowing to the Arctic Sea. Stop it spreading! Read more. </p>
<p type="title">Go Hunting</p>
<p>Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area is belongs to two permit areas: 1608 Muotkatunturi and 1609 Angeli. A limited number of small game permits a day are sold for these areas. Visitors to the wilderness area may also obtain these permits to hunt willow grouse, hare, small carnivores and water birds during the hunting season. The impressive fells of Muotkatunturi area are especially favoures by hunters with gun dogs. Because reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood in the area, hunting with a hound is not allowed. There may be different restrictions in the area during different seasons due to reindeer herding work.</p>
<p>Many local people in Muotkatunturi area catch the willow grouse with traps for domestic use, but in a good year for sale, too. The local companies also get income by organising hunting trips. The permanent residents of the municipalities of Enontekiö, Inari and Utsjoki have a free hunting right on the state owned lands in their municipality.</p>
<p>The permits can be bought from Metsähallitus netstore (www.eräluvat.fi), at Metsähallitus Customer Service in Ivalo and at Siida - Northern Lapland Nature Centre .</p>
<p type="title">Go Berry and Mushroom Picking</p>
<p>Crowberries <em type="italic">(Empetrum nigrum) </em>grow on the fells, and Lingonberries <em type="italic">(Vaccinium vitis-idaea) </em>on the low-lying lands. Picking berries and mushrooms is allowed everywhere in the area. </p>
<p type="title">Go Swimming</p>
<p>In the wilderness area, there is one larger lake (the Lake Peltojärvi), several smaller lakes, and many rivers and brooks. The waters are refreshing even during the hot spells in the summer. There is no official beach.</p>
