<p type="title">Go Canoeing and Rowing</p>
<p>Hetta Village, which is located on the shore of Lake Ounasjärvi, is an ideal place to set off on a canoe or boat trip. The open waters of the lake offer a very pleasant place to row during sunny summer days.

<p type="title">Go Bird Watching</p>

While there visitors can also learn more about the birdlife in Joentekiäinen, the quiet pool in the River Ounasjoki and about Finnish writer and scientist Yrjö Kokko by reading the boards there. Sotkajärvi bird watching tower (www.tosilappi.fi) is situated at Sotkavuoma about 18 km from Hetta. This is an excellent bird watching spot during both migration and nesting time.</p>
<p type="title">See the Sights and Scenery</p>
<p>Visitors can climb to the top of Jyppyrävaara Hill on the edge of the village and admire the area's fell landscape from there. There is a clear view of the peaks of the Pallas-Ounastunturi Fells from the look-out campfire shelter. The northern most peak of the Pallas-Ounastunturi Fells, Pyhäkero can be reached by following the hiking trail on the south side of Lake Ounasjärvi.</p>
<p type="title">See the Visitor Centre</p>
<p>Fell Lapland Nature Centre is located in Hetta and is open year-round. The nature centre hosts exhibitions on the area's nature and hiking possibilities as well as sells fishing, hunting and snowmobile permits and maps.</p>
<p type="title">Walk on the Nature Trail</p>
<p>A nature trail with information on the area's history has its starting point at the Fell Lapland Nature Centre and leads to the top of Jyppyrävaara Hill. On the lower slope of the hill there is a trail called Peurapolku Nature Trail which features information on Wild Reindeer hunting in the area.</p>
<p type="title">Ski Cross-country on Maintained Trails</p>
<p>There are many maintained skiing trails in the Hetta Area. There is a set of trails in the Jyppyrä area as well as there are several long distance trails from the village of Hetta to Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park. Most of these trails are suited for classical and freestyle cross-country skiing. The ski trail network is maintained by the municipality of Enontekiö and by Ounaksen Tunturiladut Oy.</p>
<p type="title">Go Fishing</p>
<p>Angling and ice fishing are Everyman's Rights (www.ymparisto.fi), in the Hetta Area, which means that no permits are needed for these. Ice fishing and angling using worms as bate are forbidden completely in flowing waters. If you have purchased the Fisheries management fee (www.eraluvat.fi) you have the right to fish in all the area's lakes. To fish in other bodies of water in Hetta's surrounding area you must have paid the national fisheries management fee and have a Hetta shareholder association permit, which you can purchase from local enterprises.</p>
<p>The River Ounasjoki is suited for fly and lure fishing. To fish in the River Ounasjoki you must have paid the Fisheries management fee (www.eraluvat.fi) as well have permission from the owner of the water area. As different parts of the river are owned by different shareholder associations, it is divided into several permit areas. The beginning of the river and all other bodies of water in the Hetta Area are owned by the Hetta shareholder association. The Vuontisjärvi shareholder association's permit area begins at Haarakoski, where the River Käkkälöjoki flows into the River Ounasjoki. Within the municipality of Enontekiö there are also some parts of the river owned by the state and by the Peltovuoma shareholder association. The portion of the river which is covered by a single permit starts only after Lake Ounasjärvi once the river crosses into the municipality of Kittilä. For more information on fishing at the River Ounasjoki or in the Hetta Area contact Fell Lapland Nature Centre.</p>
<p type="title">Go Cycling</p>

<p type="title">Go Orienteering</p>
<p>The terrain in the Hett a Area is ideal for orienteering. The area around Jyppyrä is the best place for beginners while the Ounastunturi area is challenging even for experienced orienteers that are in the best shape. There is a fixed orienteering course at Jyppyrä and evening races are organised there occasionally. Maps made for orienteering are sold by  Fell Lapland Nature Centre.</p>
<p type="title">Go Snowshoe Walking</p>
<p>Along with skiing snowshoe walking is a good way to cross the area's terrain during winter. Marked snowshoe walking trails have even been set up in the Jyppyrä area during quite a few years. The snowshoe walking conditions in the area will improve in the future, as the ski resort at Jyppyrä is developed.</p>
<p type="title">Go Berry and Mushroom Picking</p>
<p>The Hetta Area is a wonderful destination for those who enjoy picking berries and mushrooms. There is an abundance of blueberries, lingonberries and cloudberries. If looking for mushrooms you will not likely have an empty basket for long either as there are plentiful picking spots right near the village.</p>
<p type="title">Ride a Snowmobile</p>
<p>Several snowmobile tracks leading to different parts of the municipality of Enontekiö, to Muonio and to Kittilä run through the Hetta Area. No permits are needed for riding these tracks. The Hetta Area snowmobile tracks are maintained by the municipality of Enontekiö (www.enontekio.fi).
