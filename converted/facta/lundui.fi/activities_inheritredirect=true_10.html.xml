<p type="title">Ski Cross-country off Trails</p>

<p type="title">Go Fishing</p>
<p>There are plenty of rivers in Tarvantovaara Wilderness Area, which are in their natural state and have a diverse array of fish in them. The most common catches are the Grayling (  <em type="italic">Thymallus thymallus </em>) and the Whitefish (  <em type="italic">Goregonus lavaretus </em>), but Trout (  <em type="italic">Salmo trutta) </em>is also quite common at some spots.  </p>
<p>Angling and ice fishing are Everyman's Rights (www.ymparisto.fi) in Tarvantovaara Wilderness Area. This means that you will not need a permit. Angling with worm bait and ice fishing are forbidden in flowing waters. To fish in the wilderness area's multiple rivers you must have paid the national fishing management fee (www.eraluvat.fi) as well as have the Metsähallitus recreational fishing permit 1551 (www.eraluvat.fi) for the Enontekiö area. Fishing permits are sold by Fell Lapland Nature Centre , other Metsähallitus customer service points and local tourist enterprises.</p>
<p type="title">Go Cycling</p>
<p>Mountain biking is permitted on the wilderness area's trails . A day trip by bike is a wonderful way to see the area.</p>
<p type="title">Go Hunting</p>
<p>The Tarvantovaara wilderness area is divided into two hunting areas. The area's eastern part belongs to hunting area 1614 Hetta-Karesuvanto and the western area to 1613 Käsivarsi. Species that may be hunted mainly include willow grouse, hares and water fowl. Hunting permits can be bought from Metsähallitus netstore (www.eräluvat.fi) and at the Fell Lapland Nature Centre .</p>
<p>A limited number of small game permits are sold each day. With these permits non-locals can hunt in the area. Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood in the area, so the use of hounds is strictly forbidden even if you have a permit. In late winter those hunting with dogs must ask the reindeer herding groups where there herds are so the hunt can keep away from them.</p>
<p>Permanent residents of the municipalities of Enontekiö, Inari and Utsjoki have the right to hunt on state-owned lands in the municipality in which they reside. Locals also have the right to hunt the Willow Grouse ( <em type="italic">Lagopus lagopus </em><em type="italic">) </em>with traps. The Willow Grouse is still an important source of income for many families in the region. </p>
<p type="title">Go Berry and Mushroom Picking</p>
<p>Picking berries and mushrooms is permitted in the area. Late July and early September is the best time to check out the cloudberries in the area's mires. In the south part of the area there are blueberries and lingonberries in the forests. Mushrooms are also found in these forests.</p>
<p type="title">Go Snowmobiling</p>
<p>The Hetta-Kilpisjärvi snowmobile track (www.metsa.fi, in Finnish) runs, via Palojärvi, through Tarvantovaara Wilderness Area. The Syväjärvi-Kaaresuvanto snowmobile track turns off of the Hetta-Kilpisjärvi one.</p>
